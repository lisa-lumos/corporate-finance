# 2. Introduction to Financial Statement Analysis
How do investors learn enough about a company, to know whether or not they should invest in it? How can financial managers assess the success of their own firm, and compare it to the performance of competitors? One way firms evaluate their performance, and communicate this information to investors, is through their financial statements.

## 2.1 Firm's disclosure of financial information
Financial statements are accounting reports with past performance information, that a firm issues periodically (usually quarterly and annually). 

U.S. public companies are required to file their financial statements with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on a quarterly basis. They must also send an annual report with their financial statements to their shareholders each year. 

Private companies often prepare financial statements as well, but they usually do not have to disclose these reports to the public.

Financial statements are important tools, through which investors, financial analysts, and other interested outside parties obtain information about a corporation. They are also useful for managers within the firm, as a source of information for corporate financial decisions.

Reports about a company's performance must be understandable and accurate. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) provide a common set of rules and a standard format for public companies to use when they prepare their reports. This standardization also makes it easier to compare the financial results of different firms.

Investors also need some assurance that the financial statements are prepared accurately. Corporations are required to hire a neutral third party, aka an auditor, to check the annual financial statements, to ensure that the annual financial statements are reliable and prepared according to GAAP. 

Every public company is required to produce 4 financial statements: 
- the balance sheet, 
- the income statement, 
- the statement of cash flows, 
- the statement of stockholders' equity.

## 2.2 The balance sheet
The "balance sheet", or "statement of financial position", lists the firm's assets and liabilities, providing a snapshot of the firm's financial position at a given point in time:
- The "assets" list the cash, inventory, property, plant, and equipment, and other investments the company has made
- the "liabilities" show the firm's obligations to creditors

Stockholders' equity, the difference between the firm's assets and liabilities, is an accounting measure of the firm's net worth. `Assets = Liabilities + Stockholders' Equity`. 

Assets. They are divided into:
1. Current Assets. Cash, or assets that could be converted into cash within one year.
2. Long-Term Assets. Net property, plant, and equipment. Brand names and trademarks, patents, customer relationships, and employees. 

The "book value" of an asset, shown in firm's financial statements, is equal to its acquisition cost less accumulated depreciation. 

Liabilities. They are divided into:
1. Current Liabilities. Liabilities that will be satisfied within one year, such as accounts payable, short-term debt, owed taxes, etc. 
2. Long-term Liabilities. Liabilities that extend beyond one year. Long-term debt, Capital leases (such as building lease), Deferred taxes, etc. 

The difference between "current assets" and "current liabilities" is the firm's "net working capital", the capital available in the short term to run the business. Firms with low/negative net working capital may face a shortage of funds, unless they generate sufficient cash from their ongoing activities.

The book value of equity, while accurate from an accounting perspective, is an inaccurate assessment of the true value of the firm's equity (due to outdated data, unmeasurable assets such as employee skills, etc).

Successful firms are often able to borrow in excess of the "book value" of their assets, because creditors recognize that the "market value" of the assets is far higher than the "book value". Thus, the book value of equity will often differ substantially from the amount investors are willing to pay for the equity.

The total "market value" of a firm's equity equals the number of shares outstanding times the firm's market price per share: `Market Value of Equity = Shares outstanding * Market price per share`. 

The "market value" of equity is often referred to as the company's market capitalization (or "market cap"). The market value of a stock does not depend on the historical cost of the firm's assets; instead, it depends on what investors expect those assets to produce in the future.

The "market-to-book ratio", also called the "price-to-book P/B ratio": 
`Market-to-Book Ratio = Market Value of Equity / Book Value of Equity`.
