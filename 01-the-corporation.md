# 1. The Corporation
In 1819, the U.S. Supreme Court established the legal precedent, that the property of a corporation, like that of a person, is private, and entitled to protection under the U.S. Constitution.

Before this, the owners of a corporation were exposed to the possibility, that the state could take their business. This concern was real enough to stop most businesses from incorporating. 

Today, the corporate structure is ubiquitous all over the world, and yet continues to evolve in the face of new forces. In 2008 the financial crisis once again transformed the financial landscape, bringing down giants like Lehman Brothers, and reshaping investment banks like Goldman Sachs into government-guaranteed commercial banks. 

Government bailouts have provoked challenging questions, regarding the role of the federal government in the control and management of private corporations. In the wake of the crisis, significant reforms of the regulation, and oversight of financial markets were passed into law. 

## 1.1 The Four Types of Firms
The 4 major types of firms: 
- Sole proprietorships
- Partnerships
- Limited liability companies (LLC)
- Corporations

### Sole proprietorships
It is a business owned and run by one person. They are usually very small with a few employees. Although they do not account for much sales revenue in the economy, they are the most common type of firm in the world. 

Nearly 72% of businesses in the US are sole proprietorships, although they generate only 4% of the revenue. Contrast this with corporations, which make up under 18% of firms, but are responsible for 83% of US revenue. 

Key characteristics:
1. They are straightforward to set up. So many new businesses use this organizational form.
2. Its principal limitation is that, there is no separation between the firm and the owner - the firm can have only one owner. If there are other investors, they cannot hold an ownership stake in the firm.
3. The owner has *unlimited* personal liability for any of the firm's debts. So if the firm defaults on any debt payment, the lender can (and will) require the owner to repay the loan from personal assets. An owner who cannot afford to repay the loan must declare personal bankruptcy.
4. The life of a sole proprietorship is limited to the life of the owner. It is also difficult to transfer ownership of a sole proprietorship.

For most businesses, the disadvantages of a sole proprietorship outweigh the advantages. As soon as the firm reaches the point, at which it can borrow without the owner agreeing to be personally liable, the owners typically convert the business into a form, that limits the owner's liability.

### Partnerships
It is identical to a sole proprietorship, except it has more than one owner.

Key features:
1. All partners are liable for the firm's debt. 
2. The partnership ends on the death/withdrawal of any single partner, although partners can avoid liquidation, if the partnership agreement provides for alternatives, such as a buyout of a deceased/withdrawn partner.

Some old and established businesses remain partnerships, or sole proprietorships. Often, these firms are the types of businesses, in which the owners' personal reputations are the basis for the businesses. e.g., law firms, groups of doctors, and accounting firms. For such enterprises, the partners' personal liability increases the confidence of the firm's clients, that the partners will strive to maintain their reputation.

A limited partnership is a partnership with two kinds of owners: general partners, and limited partners. 
- General partners have the same rights and privileges as partners in a (general) partnership - they are personally liable for the firm's debt obligations. 
- Limited partners have limited liability - their liability is limited to their investment. Their private property cannot be seized to pay off the firm's outstanding debts. Furthermore, the death/withdrawal of a limited partner does not dissolve the partnership, and a limited partner's interest is transferable. However, a limited partner has no management authority, and cannot legally be involved in the managerial decision making for the business.

Private equity funds, and venture capital funds, are two examples of industries dominated by limited partnerships. 
- In these firms, a few general partners contribute some of their own capital, and raise additional capital from outside investors, who are limited partners. 
- The general partners control how all the capital is invested. Most often they will actively participate in running the businesses that they choose to invest in. 
- The outside investors play no active role in the partnership, other than monitoring how their investments are performing.

### Limited Liability Companies (LLC)
It is a limited partnership, without a general partner. So all the owners have limited liability, but unlike limited partners, they can also run the business.

The LLC is a relatively new phenomenon in the US (started in 1977 WY only).

### Corporations
A corporation is a legally defined, artificial being, separate from its owners. So it has many of the legal powers that people have. It can enter into contracts, acquire assets, incur obligations, and, it enjoys protection under the U.S. Constitution, against the seizure of its property. 

Because a corporation is a legal entity, separate and distinct from its owners, it is solely responsible for its own obligations. Consequently, the owners/employees/customers of a corporation are not liable for any obligations the corporation enters into. Similarly, the corporation is not liable for any personal obligations of its owners.

Corporations must be legally formed, which means that, the state in which it is incorporated must formally give its consent to the incorporation, by chartering it. Setting up a corporation is therefore considerably more costly, than setting up a sole proprietorship.

For jurisdictional purposes, a corporation is a citizen of the state in which it is incorporated. 

The corporate charter specifies the initial rules, that govern how the corporation is run.

There is no limit on the number of owners a corporation can have. Because most corporations have many owners, each owner owns only a small fraction of the corporation. The entire ownership stake of a corporation is divided into shares, known as stock.

The collection of all the outstanding shares of a corporation is known as the "equity" of the corporation. An owner of a share of stock in the corporation is known as a shareholder, stockholder, or equity holder, and is entitled to dividend payments, that is, payments made at the discretion of the corporation to its equity holders.

Shareholders usually receive a share of the dividend payments, that is proportional to the amount of stock they own. For example, a shareholder who owns 25% of the firm's shares will be entitled to 25% of the total dividend payment.

A unique feature of a corporation is that, there is no limitation on who can own its stock. That is, an owner of a corporation need not have any special expertise or qualification. This feature allows free trade in the shares of the corporation, and provides one of the most important advantages of organizing a firm as a corporation, rather than as sole proprietorship, partnership, or LLC. Corporations can raise substantial amounts of capital, because they can sell ownership shares to anonymous outside investors.

The availability of outside funding has enabled corporations to dominate the economy. 

### Tax Implications for Corporate entities
An important difference between the types of organizational forms, is the way they are taxed. Because a corporation is a separate legal entity, a corporation's profits are subject to taxation, separate from its owners' tax obligations. 

In effect, shareholders of a corporation pay taxes twice. First, the corporation pays tax on its profits, and then when the remaining profits are distributed to the shareholders, the shareholders pay their own personal income tax on this income. This system is sometimes referred to as `"double taxation"`.

For example, you are a shareholder in a corporation. The corporation earns $5 per share before taxes. After it has paid taxes, it will distribute the rest of its earnings to you as a dividend. The dividend is income to you, so you will then pay taxes on these earnings. 

`S Corporations`: The corporate organizational structure is the only organizational structure subject to double taxation. However, the U.S. Internal Revenue Code allows an exemption from double taxation for "S" corporations, which are corporations that elect `subchapter S tax treatment`.

Under these tax regulations, the firm's profits (and losses) are not subject to corporate taxes, but instead, are allocated directly to shareholders, based on their ownership share. The shareholders must include these profits as income on their individual tax returns (even if no money is distributed to them). However, after the shareholders have paid income taxes on these profits, no further tax is due.

Most countries offer investors in corporations some relief from double taxation. The United States offers partial relief, by having a lower tax rate on dividend income than on other sources of income. As of 2015, for most investors, qualified dividends are taxed at up to 20%, a rate significantly below their personal income tax rate. Despite this relief, the effective corporate tax rate in the U.S. is one of the highest in the world. 

The government places strict limitations on the qualifications for subchapter S tax treatment. In particular, the shareholders of such corporations must be individuals who are U.S. citizens or residents, and there can be no more than 100 of them. Because most corporations have no restrictions on who owns their shares, or the number of shareholders, they cannot qualify for subchapter S treatment. Thus most large corporations are `"C" corporations`, which are corporations subject to corporate taxes. S corporations account for less than 25% of all corporate revenue.

## 1.2 Ownership Versus Control of Corporations
It is often not feasible for the owners of a corporation to have direct control of the firm, because there are sometimes many owners, each of whom can freely trade their stock. That is, in a corporation, direct control and ownership are often separate. 

Rather than the owners, the board of directors and chief executive officer possess direct control of the corporation. 

The shareholders of a corporation exercise their control, by electing a board of directors, a group of people who have the ultimate decision-making authority in the corporation.
