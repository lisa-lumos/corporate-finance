# 1. The Corporation
In 1819, the U.S. Supreme Court established the legal precedent, that the property of a corporation, like that of a person, is private, and entitled to protection under the U.S. Constitution.

Before this, the owners of a corporation were exposed to the possibility, that the state could take their business. This concern was real enough to stop most businesses from incorporating. 

Today, the corporate structure is ubiquitous all over the world, and yet continues to evolve in the face of new forces. In 2008 the financial crisis once again transformed the financial landscape, bringing down giants like Lehman Brothers, and reshaping investment banks like Goldman Sachs into government-guaranteed commercial banks. 

Government bailouts have provoked challenging questions, regarding the role of the federal government in the control and management of private corporations. In the wake of the crisis, significant reforms of the regulation, and oversight of financial markets were passed into law.
